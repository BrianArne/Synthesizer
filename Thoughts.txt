Investigate opening and closing steams

Classes:
  Sine
    Additive waves not working.
  Mapper
    Uncompiled. 
    Algorithm not implemented. 
    Pass by ref? or pointers? 
    How do we give partial maps to sine lineclass
    How do we get pixels from JpegParser
    Needs amplitudes
  Qt
    Nothing Implemented. API for dials and sliders
  JpegParser
    Struct inside class? How does linking work with this.


Header Files:
  Do we need header files for all objets
  Linking libs
  When are typedefs created so all files can access
  Warry of typedefs across cpp files


Architecture:
  Pipe and filter
    Need Tester between Qt and Mapperd
