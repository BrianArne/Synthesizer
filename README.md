# Synthesizzler - Synthesizer for Sinewave Partial Addition

## Overview
Synthesizzler was designed as a stand alone QT and PortAudio project for building complex harmonic series tones from sine waves. A user can select a fundamental root pitch and use sliders to increase the presence of the first 15 partials above the fundamental. This tool was designed as a teaching tool for composition students. In addition, Synthesizzler is able to read .jpeg files and create 'music' from them consisting of complex sounds with different partial volumes based on the RGB values of the picture's pixels.

## Notes
Synthesizzler was create a long time and all the necessary files to build this project are not here. I originally developed this with the QT IDE but I don't believe I have any of the build files. The code is really only available as a learning exercise.
