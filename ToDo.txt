Sine Class:

  Needs a member var from mapper of amplitudes
  Needs to take in a table size in constructor that is equivalent to hz
    **44100/Hertz = table_size

Mapper Class:
  Needs to read RGBVec from JpegParser
  Needs to construct int[16] values for each partial (value should be the amplitude of the partial)
